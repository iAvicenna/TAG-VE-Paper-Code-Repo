# WHO-TAG-VE-Paper-Code-Repo
This is the code repo for the WHO TAG-VE Paper

control_comparison subdirectory contains the code for producing the results in section "Comparability of the neutralisation readout across laboratories and across assays".

clustering and landscapes subdirectories contain the code for producing the results in section "An Initial Step Towards Global Immunological Surveillance".

misc directory contains the code for some of the extra visual analysis presented in SI.

data and plots will be made available when the paper is accepted for publication.

The coordinates of antigens used in Landscapes is based on the map from [Mühlemann et.al](https://github.com/VirologyCharite/charite-hamster-map-2024/blob/main/data/240123-hamster/map-continuous-fixbottom-90-corrected.ace) 

The Bayesian models are based on [PyMC](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-1516/).
