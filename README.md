# WHO-TAG-VE-Paper-Code-Repo
This is the code repo for the WHO TAG-VE Paper

control_comparison subdirectory contains the code for producing the results in section "Comparability of the neutralisation readout across laboratories and across assays".

clustering and landscapes subdirectories contain the code for producing the results in section "An Initial Step Towards Global Immunological Surveillance".
The coordinates of antigens used in landscapes is based on the map from [MÃ¼hlemann et.al.](https://github.com/VirologyCharite/charite-hamster-map-2024/blob/main/data/240123-hamster/map-continuous-fixbottom-90-corrected.ace) 

misc directory contains the code for some of the extra visual analysis presented in SI.

The Bayesian models are based on [PyMC](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-1516/).
